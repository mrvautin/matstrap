# Matstrap

Sometimes you want to switch from Boostrap to [Material](https://material.io) design without rewriting all your markup. Welcome, **Matstrap**.

Just drop in the CSS and use all the existing Bootstrap syntax for grids, typography, buttons, modals etc.

``` html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="matstrap.min.css" media="screen">
```

### Demo

### Developing

You can either run with the details color scheme or roll your own. You can adjust the colors in the `matstrap.scss` file and build using `$ gulp sass`. You can also run `$ gulp sass:watch` to have the changes compiled on saves. Running `$ gulp build` will compile the Sass and minify. The minified file will be found in `/dist/matstrap.min.css`.
